# üß† SQL Short Notes

## üìò What is SQL?
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is used to manage and manipulate relational databases.

---

## üìÇ Types of SQL Commands

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **DDL** (Data Definition Language) | Defines structure of database objects | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE` |
| **DML** (Data Manipulation Language) | Manages data in tables | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` |
| **DQL** (Data Query Language) | Retrieves data | `SELECT` |
| **DCL** (Data Control Language) | Controls access permissions | `GRANT`, `REVOKE` |
| **TCL** (Transaction Control Language) | Manages transactions | `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT` |

---

## üß± DDL Commands

### CREATE
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);
````

### ALTER

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN age INT;
```

### DROP

```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

### TRUNCATE

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```

---

## üß© DML Commands

### INSERT

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (1, 'John', 50000);
```

### UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000 WHERE id = 1;
```

### DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
```

---

## üîç DQL ‚Äì SELECT Queries

### Basic SELECT

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

### With WHERE

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

### Sorting

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 5;
```

## üßæ Indexes

Used to speed up query performance.

```sql

## üìä Common SQL Interview Questions ‚Äî Detailed Answers

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP

| Command | Description | Rollback | Affect on Structure |
|----------|--------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **DELETE** | Removes specific rows using `WHERE` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **TRUNCATE** | Removes all rows from table (faster than DELETE) | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| **DROP** | Deletes entire table with structure | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Example:**
```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 5;
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
DROP TABLE employees;
````

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Primary Key vs Unique Key

| Feature        | PRIMARY KEY                     | UNIQUE KEY                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Uniqueness     | Ensures unique + not null       | Ensures unique but can have one null |
| Number allowed | One per table                   | Multiple per table                   |
| Purpose        | Identifies each record uniquely | Enforces data uniqueness             |

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  roll_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What are Joins and Their Types?

**Join** combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

| Join Type      | Description                         | Example                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns matching rows               | `A ‚à© B`                    |
| **LEFT JOIN**  | All from left + matching from right | `A + (A ‚à© B)`              |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | All from right + matching from left | `B + (A ‚à© B)`              |
| **FULL JOIN**  | All rows from both                  | `A ‚à™ B`                    |
| **CROSS JOIN** | Cartesian product                   | Every row with every other |

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between WHERE and HAVING

| Clause     | Used On                          | Used With         | Executes          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **WHERE**  | Filters rows before grouping     | Any query         | Before `GROUP BY` |
| **HAVING** | Filters groups after aggregation | Aggregate queries | After `GROUP BY`  |

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 40000
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What are Indexes and When to Use Them?

**Indexes** are data structures (like B-trees) that speed up data retrieval.

‚úÖ Use When:

* Searching or filtering large tables (`WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`)
* Columns often queried but not frequently updated

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid When:

* Table is small
* Columns are frequently updated/deleted (can slow DML)

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_name ON employees(name);
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Explain Normalization and Denormalization

| Term                | Meaning                                      | Purpose                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Normalization**   | Organizing data into smaller, related tables | Reduce redundancy & improve integrity |
| **Denormalization** | Combining tables for faster access           | Improve query performance             |

**Example:**

* Normalized ‚Üí separate `students` and `departments` tables
* Denormalized ‚Üí merge both for faster reports

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is a View?

A **view** is a **virtual table** based on the result of an SQL query.
It doesn‚Äôt store data itself ‚Äî only stores the query logic.

**Use Case:** Simplify complex queries or restrict data access.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_salary AS
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000;
```

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN

| Feature       | INNER JOIN                 | OUTER JOIN                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Matching rows | Returns only matching rows | Returns matching + non-matching |
| Data loss     | Non-matching rows excluded | Non-matching rows preserved     |
| Types         | Only one type              | LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER JOIN    |

**Example:**

```sql
-- INNER JOIN
SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;

-- LEFT OUTER JOIN
SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
```
