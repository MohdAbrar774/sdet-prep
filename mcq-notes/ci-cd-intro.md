# 🧩 CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) — Notes

---

## 🔹 What is CI/CD?
**CI/CD** stands for:
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** — Automating build and test stages  
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)** — Automating deployment/release stages  

Together, CI/CD automates the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)**, ensuring faster and more reliable updates.

---

## 🔹 Understanding with Example
Imagine a **team of developers** working on an **e-commerce application**:
- Each developer writes code for a new feature or bug fix.
- They commit and push their changes to their own branch.
- Later, they integrate (merge) these changes into the main branch.
- The code is **built**, **tested**, and then **deployed**.

This entire cycle keeps repeating as the app evolves.

---

## 🔹 Stages of Software Development Lifecycle
1. **Development**
   - Developers write code for new features.
   - Changes are committed and pushed to branches.

2. **Build**
   - Source code + dependencies → **build artifact**
   - e.g., `.apk` for Android, `.exe` for Windows

3. **Testing**
   - **Unit testing:** Checks individual components  
   - **Integration testing:** Checks if modules work together  
   - **Regression testing:** Ensures old features still work  

4. **Release**
   - Application made available to users.

5. **Deployment**
   - Code deployed to specific environments:
     - 🧑‍💻 **Dev** → internal testing  
     - ⚙️ **Staging** → demo/review  
     - 🌍 **Prod** → live for end users  

---

## 🔹 Why CI/CD is Needed
### Before CI/CD (Manual process):
- Everything was done manually → **slow and error-prone**
- Common problems:
  - Merge conflicts & **Integration Hell**
  - Manual testing → **missed bugs**
  - **Infrequent releases**
  - **Rollback delays** (if production fails)
  - Deployment errors due to human mistakes  

### After CI/CD:
- All steps automated → **fast**, **reliable**, **repeatable**
- Each commit triggers:
  - Build  
  - Test  
  - Deployment (optional/manual/auto)
- **Continuous feedback** for developers

## 🔹 CI/CD Pipeline Overview

| Stage | Description | Automated by |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| CI | Build + Test | Automatically triggered on code commit |
| CD | Release + Deploy | Automated to staging/production |

---

## 🔹 Continuous Integration (CI)
- Automates:
  - **Build creation**
  - **Test execution**
- Every code commit triggers a workflow to check:
  - Does the build succeed?
  - Do all tests pass?
- If failed → developer gets immediate feedback.

---

## 🔹 Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Automates:
  - **Deployment to staging**
  - Manual approval before production release
- A **manual gate** (approval step) exists before final deployment.

---

## 🔹 Continuous Deployment
- Fully automated — no manual approval.
- Once tests pass, deployment happens **directly to production**.

---

## 🔹 Summary of Differences

| Term | Automation Level | Production Deployment |
|------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **Continuous Integration** | Build + Test | ❌ |
| **Continuous Delivery** | Build + Test + Staging Deploy | ✅ (manual approval) |
| **Continuous Deployment** | Build + Test + Production Deploy | ✅ (fully automated) |

---

## 🔹 Benefits of CI/CD
✅ Faster development and release cycles  
✅ Fewer bugs and integration errors  
✅ Reliable rollback & recovery  
✅ Continuous feedback  
✅ Improves team productivity and collaboration  

---

## 🔹 Common CI/CD Tools
| Category | Tools |
|-----------|--------|
| Cloud-based | **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI/CD**, **CircleCI**, **Travis CI** |
| Self-hosted | **Jenkins**, **Bamboo**, **TeamCity** |
| Others | **AWS CodePipeline**, **Azure DevOps**, **Bitbucket Pipelines** |

---

## 🔹 Example: GitHub Actions CI/CD Script (YAML)
```yaml
name: Node.js CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

- Runs automatically on every push or PR.
- Builds and tests the app.
- Shows ✅ (success) or ❌ (failure) on GitHub.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- CI/CD = Automation of build, test, and deployment.
- CI → Ensures code integration is smooth and error-free.
- CD → Ensures fast and safe delivery of updates.
- Continuous Deployment → Fully automated delivery to production.
- CI/CD improves **speed, reliability, and consistency** in software delivery.
