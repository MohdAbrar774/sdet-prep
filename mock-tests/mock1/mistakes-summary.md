# ðŸ§  Mistakes Summary â€” Mock Test 1 (SDET Prep)

| No | Question / Topic                             | Type     | Correct Answer / Approach                              | Why I Missed It                               | Fix / Action Plan                                |
| -- | -------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | Java String comparison (`==` vs `.equals()`) | Java     | `==` compares reference; `.equals()` compares content. | I assumed both compare content.               | Revise String pool, test code examples manually. |
| 2  | Checked vs Unchecked exceptions              | Java     | `IOException` is checked; runtime ones are unchecked.  | Didnâ€™t recall the exception hierarchy.        | Make flashcards for exception types.             |
| 3  | Iterable vs Iterator                         | Java     | `iterator()` is from `Iterable`.                       | Misremembered the interface source.           | Revisit Java Collection hierarchy diagram.       |
| 4  | Local variable default value                 | Java     | Local vars must be initialized.                        | Thought they default to 0 like instance vars. | Code a few examples to confirm behavior.         |
| 5  | Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)                | Testing  | Improves coverage + reduces redundancy.                | Chose only partial reason.                    | Revise test design techniques from notes.        |
| 6  | XPath `//` vs `/`                            | Selenium | `//` = Relative XPath.                                 | Confused the meaning.                         | Practice 5 locator examples.                     |
| 7  | REST full form                               | API      | Representational State Transfer.                       | Confused acronym.                             | Add to API notes, repeat in flash review.        |
| 8  | CI Tool for pipelines                        | DevOps   | Jenkins.                                               | Selected Postman by mistake.                  | Note: Postman = API testing; Jenkins = CI/CD.    |

| Problem                    | Difficulty | Time Taken | Main Mistake                           | Fix / Learning                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Easy â€“ Two Sum             | Easy       | 25 min     | Initially Solved With double loop.     | Use HashMap for Optimal Solution.             |
| Medium â€“ Longest Substring | Medium     | 65 min     | Struggled with ith iterator updation . | Redo 2 more sliding window problems. |
